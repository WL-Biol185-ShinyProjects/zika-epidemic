# Zika Virus Overview
  
  The Zika virus is spread primarily by the bite of an infected *Aedes* species mosquito, but can also be transmitted from a pregnant woman to her fetus, through sex, and through blood transfusions. 
  
**Symptoms**
  
  Most people infected with Zika do not show symptoms, but the most common symptoms of Zika are fever, rash, headache, joint pain, red eyes, and muscle pain. Sympotoms can last for several days to weeks, but are rarely fatal. Individuals with Zika usually do not requrie hospitalization and are likely to be protected from future infections once they have contracted the virus. 
  
**Risk**
 
  Zika poses the biggest risk to reproductive age and pregnant women. Zika causes birth defets, including called [microcephaly][id] and other severe brain defects in the fetus, other problems such as miscarriage, stillbirth, and other birth defects.  [Guillain-Barre syndrome][id2], an uncommon sickness of the nervous system has also been reported in areas affected by Zika. 
  
**Treatment/Prevention**
 
  Although there is no vaccine for Zika, the best way to prevent Zika is to minimize exposure to mosquitos by wearing long-sleeved clothing and long pants, using insect repellents approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and staying in shelters from mosquitos, such as indoors or screened in areas. Prevent sexual transmission of Zika by using condoms or abstaining from sex
